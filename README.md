# How did Insurance Companies perform during the Presidency of Obama?

**Time Series Analysis (R programming)**

The **Question** is whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA, also called Obamacare) introduced in the presidency of Barack Obama (Jan 2009 to Jan 2017), increased the profits of those insurance companies and made those companies hot in the financial market.

I used stock price and google search trends in the analysis. Stock price is an indicator to show the companiesâ€™ market capital and google trends show the public interests over time. I examined the stock growth rates and public google search trends of **United**, **Aetna**, and **Blue Cross Blue Shield**, and formed the data (from Jan 2009 to Dec 2016) into time series models to forecast trends in 2017 and 2018. The predicted number is compared to the real data in that period.

In conclusion, health insurance companies have significant higher stock growth rates during the presidency of Obama. The adjusted monthly growth rate of United Healthcare is 2.05%, which means the annual rate is about 27%. No seasonal pattern in stock growth rate is found. The seasonal pattern in searching the insurance companies on Google is strong. The predictions for the search rate are close to the true value by using seasonal ARIMA models. However, even the stocks have strong growth rate, the search trends in the past decade are relatively constant, since the health insurance is a necessity. In addition, stock market leads Google search trends.
